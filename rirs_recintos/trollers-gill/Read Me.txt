Description: 
Impulse responses measured around the limestone gorge known as Troller’s Gill in the Yorkshire Dales. Site 1 is a wide V-shape valley with hills either side, found at the co-ordinates: 54.054264, -1.900317. Site 2 is a small U-shape valley (the limestone gauge itself) with steep cliffs either side, found at the co-ordinates: 54.052596, -1.896829. Finally, site 3 is the open area at the bottom of Troller’s Gill, found at the co-ordinates: 54.051784, -1.896455. Diagramas describing each site can be found under the Images tab. For each site there are two sets of impulse responses: One is made with a single directional sound source (IR-1), and the other is made with an array of four directional sound sources pointing in different directions in an attempt to better approximate an omni-directional source (IR-2). In each case the soundfield microphone is pointed directly at the loudspeaker.
