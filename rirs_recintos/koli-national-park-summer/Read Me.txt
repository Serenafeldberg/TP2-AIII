Description: 
Impulse Responses measured in the forest of Koli National Park in Finland during mid-summer. There was no snow on the ground at this time. Impulse responses were captured at four sites and were measured using a B-format Soundfield microphone. For each site there are two sets of impulse responses: One is made with a single directional sound source (IR-1), and the other is made with an array of four directional sound sources pointing in different directions in an attempt to better approximate an omni-directional source (IR-2).
